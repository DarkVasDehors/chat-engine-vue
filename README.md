# PubNub Chat Engine + Vue + IBM Watson

> A chat app with vue and PubNub Chat Engine.

**LATEST: Currently constructing the front end**
- Next I will integrate Chat Engine
- Then I will build PubNub Functions that will access IBM Watsons conversation API to do a realtime chatbot and message enhancements.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
